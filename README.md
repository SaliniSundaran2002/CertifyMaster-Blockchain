# Certify Master - Blockchain

Certify Master is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows for the issuance of digital certificates on the blockchain. Built with React and integrated with Ethereum smart contracts, this project enables the creation, issuance, and verification of certificates, making the entire process secure, transparent, and immutable.


## Introduction
Certify Master allows you to issue and manage blockchain-based certificates. The certificates are minted and stored on the blockchain, ensuring their authenticity and preventing tampering. The application connects with the Ethereum network through Metamask, and certificates are issued via smart contracts.

## Features
- **Issue Certificates**: Issue blockchain-based certificates by specifying the recipient's name, course, grade, certificate ID, and issue date.
- **Connect Metamask**: Interact with the blockchain through Metamask wallet integration.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Blockchain Verification**: All issued certificates are verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain
- **BrowserProvider**: ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- **Wallet Integration**: Metamask for connecting to the Ethereum network
